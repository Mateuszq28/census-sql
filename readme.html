Find duplcated PESELs - works

```shell
grep -oE '\b[0-9]{11}\b' add_people.sql | sort | uniq -d
```

Find duplcated PESELs - doesn't work

```shell
# regex
\b(\d{11})\b(?=.*\b\1\b)

grep -oE '\b[0-9]{11}\b' add_people.sql | sort | uniq -d | grep -Ff - add_people.sql

# didn't try
grep -oE '\b[0-9]{11}\b' add_people.sql | awk '{count[$0]++} END {for (num in count) if (count[num] > 1) print num}'
```

substitute part of a string<br/>
in this case:<br/>
change every 5-zeros string like "0000" into ranfom 5-digit number

```shell
# didn't try
while grep -q "00000" file.txt; do
    sed -i "0,/00000/s//$(shuf -i 10000-99999 -n 1)/" file.txt
done

# works
perl -i -pe 's/00000/sprintf("%05d", int(rand(100000)))/ge' file.txt
```

<h3>Modyfying Table</h3>
